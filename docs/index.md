## Data
### Aggregated indicators (Gini coefficients, global tax ratios, etc.)
You can download here the Stata files (.dta) containing the latest indicators obtained with our microsimulation method.
- Core model (82 country-years): [ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_coremodel.dta](https://github.com/JulienBlasco/consumption-taxes/blob/master/DTA/ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_coremodel.dta?raw=true "ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_coremodel.dta")
- Extended model (126 country-years): [ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_xtnddmodel](https://github.com/JulienBlasco/consumption-taxes/raw/master/DTA/ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_xtnddmodel.dta "ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_xtnddmodel")

### Percentiles
You can download here the Stata files (.dta) containing the variables we computed using our microsimulation method, broken down in disposable income percentiles. Warning: these data are maily for graphing purposes, not detailed analysis at the percentile level.
