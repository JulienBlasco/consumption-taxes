## Data
### Aggregated indicators (Gini coefficients, global tax ratios, etc.)
You can download here the Stata files (.dta) containing the latest indicators obtained with our microsimulation method.
- Core model (82 country-years): [ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_coremodel.dta](https://github.com/JulienBlasco/consumption-taxes/blob/master/DTA/ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_coremodel.dta?raw=true "ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_coremodel.dta")
- Extended model (126 country-years): [ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_xtnddmodel](https://github.com/JulienBlasco/consumption-taxes/raw/master/DTA/ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_xtnddmodel.dta "ConsumptionTaxes_indicators_xtnddmodel")

### Percentiles
You can download here the Stata files (.dta) containing the variables obtained with our microsimulation method, broken down in percentiles of disposable income. Please note that these data are mainly for graphing purposes, not detailed analysis at the percentile level.
- Core model (82 country-years): [ConsumptionTaxes_percentiles_coremodel](https://github.com/JulienBlasco/consumption-taxes/raw/master/DTA/ConsumptionTaxes_percentiles_coremodel.dta "ConsumptionTaxes_percentiles_coremodel")
- Extended model (126 country-years): [ConsumptionTaxes_percentiles_xtnddmodel](https://github.com/JulienBlasco/consumption-taxes/raw/master/DTA/ConsumptionTaxes_percentiles_xtnddmodel.dta "ConsumptionTaxes_percentiles_xtnddmodel")

### Effective tax rates on consumption
The following dataset contains the implicit tax rates on consumption computed in our project with OECD National Accounts data: [18-07-27 OECD_itrcs.dta](https://github.com/JulienBlasco/consumption-taxes/raw/master/Itrcs%20scalings/Implicit%20tax%20rates/DTA/18-07-27%20OECD_itrcs.dta)

## Sources

Our data is extracted from surveys on income and consumption, harmonized by the [Luxembourg Income Study](https://www.lisdatacenter.org). We used [OECD Statistics](https://stats.oecd.org) for National Accounts data on income, consumption and consumption tax revenue. The [code](https://github.com/JulienBlasco/consumption-taxes) is available on GitHub.
